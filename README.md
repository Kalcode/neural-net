# Neural Network Learning Project

## Overview

This project is a hands-on exploration of neural networks, implemented in TypeScript and run using Bun. The goal is to create a simple neural network from scratch to understand the underlying concepts and mechanisms.

## What is a Neural Network?

A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. These networks can learn from data to perform tasks such as pattern recognition, classification, and prediction. Key components include:

1. Input Layer: Receives initial data
2. Hidden Layers: Process and transform data
3. Output Layer: Produces the final result
4. Weights and Biases: Adjustable parameters that the network learns
5. Activation Functions: Non-linear functions that introduce complexity
6. Training Process: Adjusting weights and biases to minimize errors

Neural networks "learn" by adjusting their internal parameters based on the difference between their predictions and actual results, a process called backpropagation.

## Features

- Implementation of a basic neural network in TypeScript
- Utilizes Bun for fast execution and development
- Designed for learning and experimentation
- Demonstrates solving various logic gate problems and the Iris classification task using neural networks

## Example Problems

This project includes several examples to demonstrate the capabilities of our neural network implementation:

1. XOR Problem: A classic non-linearly separable problem that requires a hidden layer to solve.
2. AND Gate: A simple linearly separable problem.
3. NAND Gate: The inverse of the AND gate.
4. OR Gate: Another linearly separable problem.
5. Half Adder: A combination of XOR and AND gates, demonstrating more complex logic.
6. Iris Classification: A multi-class classification problem using the famous Iris dataset.

Each of these examples showcases different aspects of neural network learning and application.
