# Neural Network Learning Project

## Overview

This project is a hands-on exploration of neural networks, implemented in TypeScript and run using Bun. The goal is to create a simple neural network from scratch to understand the underlying concepts and mechanisms.

## Features

- Implementation of a basic neural network in TypeScript
- Utilizes Bun for fast execution and development
- Designed for learning and experimentation

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your system
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript and neural network concepts

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   bun install
   ```
3. Run the project:
   ```
   bun run start
   ```

## Project Structure

(To be updated as the project progresses)

## Learning Goals

- Understand the basic architecture of neural networks
- Implement forward and backward propagation
- Experiment with different activation functions
- Learn about training processes and optimization techniques

## Future Enhancements

- Browser-based visualization of the neural network
- Implementation of different types of neural networks
- Performance optimizations

## Contributing

This project is primarily for learning purposes. However, suggestions and improvements are welcome!
